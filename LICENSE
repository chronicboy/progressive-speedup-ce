CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with
a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to
the Work and publicly distribute the Work under CC0, thereby affording all
the rights and freedoms set forth in CC0, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Public Dedication.

Affirmer's Understanding of CC0

The Affirmer understands and intends that this Public Dedication is intended
to be a legally binding act of dedication to the public domain, and that the
Affirmer hereby irrevocably and unconditionally dedicates to the public domain
all of the Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work to the fullest
extent permitted by law, including without limitation all rights that may be
claimed in the Work, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well
as future claims and extensions of Copyright and Related Rights, whether
arising under statute, common law, or any other legal theory).

Affirmer makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to
the detriment of the Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
such dedication shall not be subject to revocation. Affirmer understands that
such irrevocable dedication means that Affirmer, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, hereby claims, abandons, transfers, waives, surrenders and
relinquishes all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and related
claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing
as well as future claims and extensions of Copyright and Related Rights),
which Affirmer may have, may have had or may hereafter have in the Work, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, in all territories worldwide.

Affirmer disclaims fully any intention to exercise any Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work, either now or in the future, and Affirmer makes this
dedication in the manner specified above, without reliance upon, enforcement
of, or performance of any Copyright and Related Rights from or by any person
or entity, including without limitation any expectation, promise or
encouragement, whether express or implied, that such Copyright and Related
Rights will or may be exercised or enforced, either now or in the future.

Public License Fallback

Should any part of the Public Dedication for any reason be judged legally
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Public Dedication shall
be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Public
Dedication is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable
and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License
shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid
or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such
case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his
or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either
case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
